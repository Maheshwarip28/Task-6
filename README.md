## 📚 Key Learnings:

### ✅ Best Practices for Strong Passwords:
- Use at least **12 characters**
- Combine **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**
- Avoid using common words or easily guessable info (e.g., `123`, `password`, birthdays)
- Use **passphrases** (e.g., `Blue$Sky&Rain@2024`) for better memorability and strength

### ❌ Common Mistakes:
- Short passwords (less than 8 characters)
- Using dictionary words or names
- Reusing passwords across accounts


## ⚠️ Common Password Attacks:

### 🔓 Brute Force Attack:
Tries all possible combinations to guess the password. **Longer and complex passwords** make this attack harder.

### 📖 Dictionary Attack:
Uses a list of common words to crack passwords. **Avoid real words or predictable combinations.**

## 🛡️ Additional Security Tips:
- Use **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** wherever possible.
- Consider using a **Password Manager** to store complex passwords securely.
- Change your passwords regularly, especially after data breaches.
